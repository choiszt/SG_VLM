Planning for putting out clean towels:

1. Locate the clean towels: Check the linen closet or designated storage area for clean towels.
2. Gather the clean towels: Take a stack of clean towels and hold them securely.
3. Walk to the desired location: Identify the area where the clean towels are needed, such as the bathroom or bedroom.
4. Open the towel rack or towel holder: If necessary, open the towel rack or holder where the clean towels will be placed.
5. Place the clean towels on the rack or holder: Carefully place the towels on the rack or holder, ensuring they are neatly folded or hung.
6. Arrange the towels: Adjust the position of the towels to ensure they are evenly spaced and visually appealing.
7. Check for any remaining towels: Confirm that all clean towels have been placed out, and return any unused towels to their designated storage area.
