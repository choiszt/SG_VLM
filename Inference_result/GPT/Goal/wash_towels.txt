Action Planning for Washing Towels:

1. Gather all the dirty towels from around the house.
2. Sort the towels based on their color and fabric type (e.g., separate white towels from colored towels and delicate towels from regular ones).
3. Pre-treat any stains on the towels by applying a stain remover or laundry detergent directly to the affected areas.
4. Load the towels into the washing machine, making sure not to overload it.
5. Add the appropriate amount of laundry detergent based on the machine's instructions.
6. Set the washing machine to the appropriate cycle and water temperature for the towels.
7. Start the washing machine and wait for the cycle to complete.

Note: Remember to read and follow the specific instructions on the labels of your towels and the washing machine for optimal results.
