Planning to clean tennis balls:

1. Gather all the dirty tennis balls in a container.
2. Fill a sink or bucket with warm water and add a small amount of mild detergent.
3. Place the dirty tennis balls in the soapy water and let them soak for a few minutes.
4. Use a soft brush or cloth to gently scrub each tennis ball, removing any dirt or stains.
5. Rinse the tennis balls thoroughly with clean water to remove any soap residue.
6. Place the clean tennis balls on a towel or drying rack to air dry.
7. Once the tennis balls are completely dry, store them in a clean container until ready to use again.
