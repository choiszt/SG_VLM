Action Plan to Clean Fur:
1. Gather necessary cleaning supplies such as a brush, mild pet shampoo, and a towel.
2. Prepare a warm bath for your pet, making sure the water is not too hot or cold.
3. Wet your pet's fur with water, starting from the neck and working your way down to the tail.
4. Apply a small amount of pet shampoo to your hands and gently massage it into your pet's fur, focusing on any areas that are particularly dirty or matted.
5. Rinse off the shampoo thoroughly, making sure to remove all traces of soap from your pet's fur.
6. Use the brush to gently comb through your pet's fur, removing any tangles or loose hair.
7. Finally, dry your pet off with a towel, ensuring they are completely dry before allowing them to roam freely.

Note: Please be cautious while cleaning your pet's fur and ensure their comfort and safety throughout the process.
