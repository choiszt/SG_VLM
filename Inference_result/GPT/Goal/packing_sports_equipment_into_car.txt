Action Plan for Packing Sports Equipment into Car:

1. Gather all the necessary sports equipment that needs to be packed.
2. Open the trunk of the car and clear out any unnecessary items.
3. Place larger sports equipment, such as bicycles or surfboards, into the trunk first, making sure they are secured and won't move during transportation.
4. Pack smaller sports equipment, such as balls or rackets, into bags or containers to keep them organized.
5. Place the bags or containers with smaller sports equipment on top of the larger items in the trunk, making sure they are stable and won't shift during the journey.
6. Check if there is any additional space in the car, such as the back seat or footwells, to pack any remaining sports equipment.
7. Close the trunk and ensure it is securely latched before starting the journey.
