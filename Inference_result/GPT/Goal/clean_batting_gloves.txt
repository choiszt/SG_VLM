Action Plan for Cleaning Batting Gloves:

1. Gather necessary materials: a bucket, mild detergent, warm water, and a soft cloth.
2. Fill the bucket with warm water and add a small amount of mild detergent.
3. Place the batting gloves in the bucket and let them soak for a few minutes.
4. Gently scrub the gloves with the soft cloth, paying attention to any stained or dirty areas.
5. Rinse the gloves thoroughly under running water to remove all soap residue.
6. Squeeze out excess water from the gloves and lay them flat to air dry.
7. Once the gloves are completely dry, check for any remaining dirt or stains. If necessary, repeat steps 4-6.
