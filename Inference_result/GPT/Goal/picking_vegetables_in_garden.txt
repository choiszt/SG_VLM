Planning for picking vegetables in the garden:

1. Gather necessary gardening tools like gloves, a basket, and a small shovel.
2. Put on the gloves to protect your hands from thorns or prickly plants.
3. Start by inspecting the garden to identify ripe vegetables that are ready to be picked.
4. Use the small shovel to gently dig around the base of the vegetable plants to loosen the soil.
5. Carefully pull out the ripe vegetables from the soil, making sure not to damage the plants or neighboring vegetables.
6. Place the picked vegetables into the basket, taking care to separate different types of vegetables if needed.
7. Once the basket is full or you have finished picking all the ripe vegetables, bring them inside to be washed and prepared for use.
