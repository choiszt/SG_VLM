Sure! Here's a simple 7-step action plan for putting away bicycles:

1. Gather necessary tools and equipment, such as a bike stand or hooks.
2. Clear a designated storage area, ensuring there is enough space for the bicycles.
3. Position the bike stand or hooks in the storage area, ensuring stability.
4. Lift the first bicycle and place it securely on the bike stand or hang it on the hooks.
5. Repeat step 4 for each additional bicycle, making sure they are properly positioned and secured.
6. Check that all bicycles are stable and won't fall or damage each other.
7. Close the storage area, ensuring it is securely locked if necessary.

Remember to follow any specific instructions or safety guidelines provided by the bicycle manufacturer or storage equipment manufacturer.
