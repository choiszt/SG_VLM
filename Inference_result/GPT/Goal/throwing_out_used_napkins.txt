Action Planning for Throwing Out Used Napkins:

1. Identify and gather all used napkins in a designated area.
2. Grab a garbage bag or trash can liner.
3. Open the garbage can or place the liner inside the trash can.
4. Pick up the used napkins one by one and place them inside the garbage bag or trash can.
5. Tie up the garbage bag if using one, or close the trash can lid securely.
6. Carry the garbage bag or remove the trash can liner from the trash can.
7. Dispose of the garbage bag in the appropriate outdoor trash bin, or empty the trash can liner into a larger outdoor trash bin.
