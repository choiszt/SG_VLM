Sure! Here is a simple 7-step action plan for taking clothes off the line:

1. Gather a laundry basket or bag to collect the clothes in.
2. Approach the clothesline and ensure it is safe to work around.
3. Start at one end of the clothesline and unclip or untie each item of clothing.
4. Shake out each clothing item to remove any excess dirt or debris.
5. Fold or roll each clothing item neatly and place it in the laundry basket or bag.
6. Continue this process until all the clothes have been removed from the line.
7. Once finished, transport the laundry basket or bag to a suitable location for further processing, such as folding or ironing.

Remember to exercise caution and follow safety guidelines while completing this task.
