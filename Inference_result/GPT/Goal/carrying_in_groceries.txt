Planning for carrying in groceries:

1. Prepare reusable bags or baskets for carrying the groceries.
2. Open the front door and make sure there is a clear path to the kitchen.
3. Pick up the first bag of groceries and carry it to the kitchen.
4. Unload the groceries and place them on the kitchen counter or designated storage area.
5. Return to the front door and repeat steps 3-4 for the remaining bags of groceries.
6. Once all the groceries are inside, close the front door.
7. Take a moment to organize the groceries and put away any perishable items that require refrigeration.
