Action Plan to Make Cookie Dough:

1. Gather all the necessary ingredients: flour, sugar, butter, eggs, vanilla extract, baking soda, and salt.
2. Measure out the required amounts of each ingredient according to the recipe.
3. In a mixing bowl, combine the softened butter and sugar. Mix until well creamed.
4. Add the eggs and vanilla extract to the bowl. Mix until all ingredients are well incorporated.
5. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.
6. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing well after each addition.
7. Once all the ingredients are fully combined and a dough forms, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before using.

Note: This action plan assumes that you have access to a fully equipped kitchen with all the necessary tools and appliances. Adjustments may be required depending on the specific recipe or dietary restrictions.
