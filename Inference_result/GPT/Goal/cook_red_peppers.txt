Action Planning for cooking red peppers:

1. Gather the ingredients: red peppers, olive oil, salt, and pepper.
2. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
3. Wash the red peppers and cut them in half, removing the seeds and stems.
4. Place the red pepper halves on a baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
5. Roast the red peppers in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until they are soft and slightly charred.
6. Remove the roasted red peppers from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes.
7. Once cooled, peel off the skin from the red peppers and they are ready to be used in your desired recipe.

Note: The cooking time and temperature may vary depending on your oven, so make sure to keep an eye on the red peppers while they are roasting.
