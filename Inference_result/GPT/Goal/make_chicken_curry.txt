Sure! Here is a simple 7-step action plan for making chicken curry:

1. Gather ingredients: Collect chicken pieces, onion, garlic, ginger, tomatoes, spices (such as turmeric, cumin, coriander), oil, and salt.
2. Prepare the chicken: Clean and cut the chicken into desired pieces.
3. Chop the vegetables: Finely chop the onion, garlic, and ginger. Dice the tomatoes.
4. Sauté the spices: Heat oil in a pan, add the chopped onion, garlic, and ginger, and sauté until golden brown.
5. Cook the chicken: Add the chicken pieces to the pan and cook until they are lightly browned.
6. Add tomatoes and spices: Add the diced tomatoes and the spices (turmeric, cumin, coriander, and salt) to the pan. Mix well and cook for a few minutes.
7. Simmer and serve: Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and let the chicken curry simmer for about 20-30 minutes until the chicken is fully cooked and the flavors are well blended. Serve hot with rice or naan bread.
