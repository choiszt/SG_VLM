Sure! Here is a simple action plan with 7 steps for folding a piece of cloth:

1. Lay the cloth flat on a clean surface, ensuring there are no wrinkles or creases.
2. Fold one side of the cloth towards the center, aligning the edges.
3. Fold the other side of the cloth towards the center, overlapping the previously folded side.
4. Smooth out any wrinkles or creases on the folded cloth.
5. Fold the bottom edge of the cloth up towards the top edge, creating a neat rectangle shape.
6. Fold the top edge of the cloth down towards the bottom edge, overlapping the previous fold.
7. Smooth out any remaining wrinkles or creases on the folded cloth and ensure it is neatly stacked or stored.

Please note that the number of steps may vary depending on the specific cloth and folding technique you prefer.
