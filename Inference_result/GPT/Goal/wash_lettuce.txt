Action Planning for washing lettuce:

1. Gather necessary materials: bowl, lettuce, and water.
2. Fill the bowl with water.
3. Place the lettuce in the bowl of water.
4. Gently swish the lettuce around in the water to remove any dirt or debris.
5. Allow the lettuce to soak in the water for a few minutes.
6. Remove the lettuce from the water and place it in a colander to drain.
7. Gently shake the colander to remove excess water from the lettuce.

Note: This plan assumes that the lettuce has already been separated into individual leaves.
