Here is a simple action planning to clean a lobster:

1. Prepare a large pot of boiling water.
2. Place the live lobster into the boiling water and cover the pot.
3. Boil the lobster for about 8-10 minutes, or until the shell turns bright red.
4. Remove the lobster from the boiling water using tongs and place it on a cutting board.
5. Use a sharp knife or kitchen shears to carefully cut through the shell along the underside of the lobster's body.
6. Hold the lobster firmly and twist the two halves of the shell to separate them.
7. Remove the lobster meat from the shell, discarding the green tomalley and any innards, and use as desired.

Please note that this is a simplified plan and it is important to follow proper safety guidelines and cooking instructions when handling live lobsters.
