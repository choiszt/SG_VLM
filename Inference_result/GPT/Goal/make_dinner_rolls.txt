Action Planning for Making Dinner Rolls:

1. Gather all the necessary ingredients for dinner rolls, including flour, yeast, sugar, salt, butter, and warm water.
2. In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, yeast, sugar, and salt. Mix well.
3. Add the butter to the mixture and slowly pour in the warm water. Mix until the dough forms.
4. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-10 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic.
5. Place the dough back into the mixing bowl, cover it with a clean cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.
6. Preheat the oven to the recommended temperature for baking dinner rolls.
7. After the dough has risen, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Shape the dough into small rolls and place them on a greased baking sheet. Let the rolls rise for an additional 15-20 minutes.
8. Once the rolls have risen again, bake them in the preheated oven for the recommended time, or until they turn golden brown.
9. Remove the dinner rolls from the oven and let them cool before serving.

Note: This action plan consists of 9 steps, but each step is important for successfully making dinner rolls.
