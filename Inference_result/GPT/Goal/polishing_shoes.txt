Action Planning for Polishing Shoes:

1. Gather necessary supplies: shoe polish, polishing brush, cloth.
2. Remove any dirt or debris from the shoes by wiping them with a damp cloth.
3. Apply a small amount of shoe polish to the brush and spread it evenly on the shoes.
4. Use the brush to scrub the shoes in circular motions, focusing on any scuff marks or stains.
5. Let the shoe polish sit on the shoes for a few minutes to allow it to penetrate the material.
6. Buff the shoes using a clean cloth, applying pressure to create a shine.
7. Repeat the process if desired, until the shoes have a polished finish.

Note: Remember to follow the specific instructions provided with your shoe polish for the best results.
