Planning for clean_greens:
1. Gather cleaning supplies such as a broom, dustpan, and cleaning solution.
2. Remove any loose debris from the greens by shaking them gently or using a soft brush.
3. Fill a sink or large bowl with water and add a small amount of cleaning solution.
4. Place the greens in the water and gently swish them around to remove dirt and impurities.
5. Remove the greens from the water and rinse them thoroughly under running water.
6. Shake off excess water and lay the greens on a clean towel to dry or use a salad spinner if available.
7. Once dry, store the greens in a clean container or use them immediately for cooking or salads.
