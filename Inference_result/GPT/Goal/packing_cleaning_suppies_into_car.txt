Sure! Here is a simple 7-step action plan for packing cleaning supplies into a car:

1. Gather all the cleaning supplies that need to be packed, such as brooms, mops, vacuum cleaners, buckets, and cleaning solutions.
2. Find a suitable storage container or box that will fit all the cleaning supplies and can easily fit into the car.
3. Organize the cleaning supplies by size and shape, placing larger items at the bottom and smaller items on top.
4. Place any delicate or breakable items, such as spray bottles or glass cleaners, in a separate bag or box to prevent damage during transportation.
5. Make sure all lids and caps are tightly secured on any bottles or containers to avoid spills or leaks during the car ride.
6. Place the storage container or box with the cleaning supplies in the trunk or designated area of the car, ensuring it is stable and won't shift during the drive.
7. Double-check that everything is securely packed, and close the trunk or secure the storage area of the car.

Remember to adjust the plan based on the specific cleaning supplies you have and the size of your car.
