Sure! Here's a simple 7-step action plan for cleaning shrimp:

1. Gather all the necessary materials: shrimp, cutting board, knife, bowl, water, and paper towels.
2. Rinse the shrimp under cold water to remove any dirt or debris.
3. Pat the shrimp dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture.
4. Use a sharp knife to carefully remove the shell from each shrimp. Start at the head and peel it off towards the tail.
5. Once the shells are removed, use the knife to make a shallow cut along the back of each shrimp to remove the vein.
6. Rinse the shrimp once again to remove any remaining debris.
7. Place the cleaned shrimp in a bowl of fresh water until you are ready to cook or use them.

Remember to always practice proper hygiene and safety measures while handling raw seafood.
