Action Planning for Cleaning Snap Peas:

1. Gather the necessary supplies: a colander, a large bowl, and a clean kitchen towel.
2. Fill the bowl with cold water and add a tablespoon of salt.
3. Rinse the snap peas under running water to remove any dirt or debris.
4. Remove the stem ends by snapping them off or using a knife.
5. Place the snap peas in the colander and submerge it in the bowl of saltwater.
6. Gently agitate the colander to ensure all the snap peas are thoroughly cleaned.
7. Lift the colander out of the water and let the snap peas drain. Pat them dry with a clean kitchen towel before using or storing.
