Sure! Here is a simple 7-step action plan for folding bandanas:

1. Gather all the bandanas that need to be folded.
2. Lay out a clean, flat surface, such as a table or bed.
3. Start with one bandana and hold it in front of you, making sure it is unfolded.
4. Fold the bandana in half lengthwise, matching the two opposite corners.
5. Fold the bandana in half again, this time matching the other two corners.
6. Smooth out any wrinkles or creases in the folded bandana.
7. Repeat steps 3-6 for each additional bandana until all of them are neatly folded.

Remember to take your time and be careful while folding the bandanas.
