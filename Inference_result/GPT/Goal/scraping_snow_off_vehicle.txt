Action Planning to Scrape Snow off Vehicle:

1. Gather necessary tools: snow brush, ice scraper, and gloves.
2. Start by removing any loose snow from the vehicle using the snow brush.
3. Use the ice scraper to remove any ice or compacted snow from the windows, windshield, and mirrors.
4. Pay special attention to the windshield wipers and ensure they are free from ice and snow.
5. Clear the snow from the roof of the vehicle, taking care not to damage the paint or roof rack.
6. Once the majority of the snow and ice is removed, brush off any remaining snow from the vehicle's body.
7. Dispose of the snow in a designated area or snow bank, away from walkways or driveways.

Remember to take breaks if needed and be cautious of any slippery surfaces while performing this task.
