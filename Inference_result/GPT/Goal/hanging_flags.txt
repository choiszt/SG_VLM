Action Planning for Hanging Flags:

1. Gather all necessary materials: flags, hooks, hammer, nails, and a ladder.
2. Identify the desired location for hanging the flags.
3. Set up the ladder securely in the chosen location.
4. Attach the hooks to the top corners of the flags.
5. Climb up the ladder with the flags and nails in hand.
6. Hammer the nails into the wall or ceiling, ensuring they are strong enough to support the weight of the flags.
7. Hang the flags on the hooks securely.

Note: Please exercise caution while using the ladder and hammer, and make sure to follow safety guidelines to avoid any accidents.
