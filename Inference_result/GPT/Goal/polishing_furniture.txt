Planning for polishing furniture:

1. Gather cleaning supplies: 
   - Microfiber cloth
   - Furniture polish spray or polish wax
   - Soft brush or toothbrush (optional)

2. Dust off the furniture: 
   - Use the microfiber cloth to remove any loose dust or debris from the surface of the furniture.

3. Apply polish: 
   - Spray a small amount of furniture polish onto the microfiber cloth or directly onto the furniture surface (if using polish wax, follow the product instructions).
   - Start with a small area and work in small circular motions, applying even pressure.

4. Polish the furniture: 
   - Continue to polish the furniture using circular motions, making sure to cover all surfaces evenly.
   - If there are any intricate or hard-to-reach areas, use a soft brush or toothbrush to gently clean and polish.

5. Check for streaks or residue: 
   - After polishing each section, inspect the furniture for streaks or residue.
   - If necessary, use a clean part of the microfiber cloth to buff away any excess polish.

6. Repeat for remaining sections: 
   - Continue steps 3-5 for the rest of the furniture, working in manageable sections.

7. Allow furniture to dry: 
   - Let the furniture air dry for a few minutes, or as per the instructions on the furniture polish product.

Note: Always follow the instructions on the furniture polish product for best results and to ensure compatibility with your furniture.
