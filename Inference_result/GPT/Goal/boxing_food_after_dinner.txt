Planning for boxing food after dinner:

1. Gather necessary supplies: Find a clean, empty food container and locate any necessary plastic wrap or lids to secure the food.
2. Separate leftovers: Identify the leftover food items from dinner and separate them into individual portions, if applicable.
3. Transfer food to container: Carefully place the leftover food into the food container, ensuring that it is properly sealed to prevent any spills or leaks.
4. Label and date the container: Use a marker or label to indicate the type of food and the date it was boxed. This will help with organization and ensure that you consume the food within a safe timeframe.
5. Store in the refrigerator: Once the food is securely packaged, place the container in the refrigerator to keep it fresh until it is ready to be consumed.
6. Clean up: Dispose of any leftover food scraps and clean any used utensils or dishes that were used during the boxing process.
7. Tidy the kitchen: Take a moment to tidy up the kitchen area, ensuring that all surfaces are clean and organized before finishing the task.
