Sure! Here is a simple 7-step action plan for packing bags or a suitcase:

Step 1: Make a packing checklist
- Take a few minutes to create a checklist of all the items you need to pack. This will help you stay organized and ensure you don't forget anything.

Step 2: Gather necessary travel documents
- Collect your passport, tickets, identification, and any other necessary travel documents. Place them in a safe and easily accessible location.

Step 3: Sort and fold clothes
- Select the clothes you want to bring and sort them based on type (e.g., tops, bottoms, undergarments). Fold them neatly to save space and make them easier to pack.

Step 4: Roll clothes to maximize space
- Roll each piece of clothing tightly instead of folding them. This technique helps save space and minimizes wrinkles.

Step 5: Pack heavier items at the bottom
- Place heavier items, such as shoes, at the bottom of the suitcase or bag. This will help distribute the weight evenly and prevent your clothes from getting crushed.

Step 6: Utilize packing cubes or organizers
- If you have packing cubes or organizers, use them to keep similar items together and make packing more efficient. For example, pack toiletries in one cube and electronics in another.

Step 7: Fill in gaps and secure items
- Fill any remaining gaps with smaller items, like socks or accessories. Make sure everything is secure and won't shift during transport.

That's it! Follow these steps, and you'll be well-prepared and organized for your trip.
