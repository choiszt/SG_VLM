Sure! Here is a simple 7-step action plan to store loose leaf tea:

1. Gather necessary materials: Gather a clean airtight container or jar, a tea infuser or tea bags, and a small spoon or measuring scoop.

2. Prepare the container: Clean and dry the container thoroughly to ensure it is free from any residual smells or flavors. This will help preserve the freshness of the loose leaf tea.

3. Measure the tea: Use the small spoon or measuring scoop to measure the desired amount of loose leaf tea. The amount will depend on your personal preference and the strength of the tea you desire.

4. Transfer the tea: Carefully transfer the measured loose leaf tea into the airtight container. Be cautious not to spill or waste any tea.

5. Seal the container: Make sure the lid of the container is tightly sealed to prevent any air or moisture from entering. This will help maintain the tea's flavor and quality.

6. Label the container: Optional but recommended, label the container with the type of tea and the date of storage. This will help you keep track of the tea's freshness and prevent confusion if you have multiple types of tea.

7. Store in a cool, dark place: Find a cool and dark spot in your kitchen or pantry to store the container. Avoid placing it near any strong-smelling substances or direct sunlight, as this can affect the tea's taste and aroma.

Remember to always follow the specific instructions provided with your loose leaf tea for the best storage conditions.
