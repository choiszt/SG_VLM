Action Planning for Putting Together a Basic Pruning Kit:

1. Identify the tools needed for a basic pruning kit: pruning shears, loppers, pruning saw, gloves, and safety goggles.

2. Gather the necessary tools from their designated storage locations.

3. Inspect the tools for any damages or defects. Replace or repair any tools that are not in proper working condition.

4. Clean the tools if they are dirty or rusty. Use a brush or cloth to remove any debris or dirt from the blades.

5. Arrange the tools in a designated container or toolbox for easy access and storage. Make sure each tool has its own compartment or space.

6. Place the gloves and safety goggles on top of the other tools, ensuring they are easily visible and accessible.

7. Store the completed pruning kit in a convenient location, such as a gardening shed or garage, for future use.

Note: Remember to always follow safety guidelines while using pruning tools and wear appropriate protective gear.
