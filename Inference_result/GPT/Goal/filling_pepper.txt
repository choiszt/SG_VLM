Action Plan for Filling Pepper:

1. Gather all the necessary ingredients and equipment, including a pepper, a cutting board, a knife, and any desired fillings.
2. Wash the pepper thoroughly under running water to remove any dirt or residue.
3. Carefully cut off the top of the pepper using the knife, creating a small opening.
4. Remove the seeds and any white membrane from the inside of the pepper.
5. Stuff the pepper with your desired fillings, such as rice, vegetables, or meat.
6. Once filled, place the top of the pepper back on to cover the opening.
7. Serve the filled pepper as desired, either by cooking it or leaving it as a raw snack.

Note: If you plan to cook the filled pepper, you may need to follow additional steps such as preheating an oven or stove, and adjusting the cooking time and temperature accordingly.
