Planning for Slicing Vegetables:

1. Gather the necessary vegetables and a cutting board.
2. Wash the vegetables thoroughly under running water.
3. Place the cutting board on a stable surface.
4. Use a sharp knife to cut off the ends of the vegetables.
5. Cut the vegetables into desired shapes and sizes.
6. As you finish cutting each vegetable, transfer them to a separate container or plate.
7. Clean up the cutting board and knife, and store them properly.

Note: Make sure to exercise caution while handling sharp objects and follow proper knife safety guidelines.
