Action Planning for Making Yams:

1. Gather ingredients: sweet potatoes, butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and marshmallows.
2. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
3. Wash and peel the sweet potatoes, then cut them into chunks.
4. Boil the sweet potato chunks until they are tender and easily mashed.
5. Drain the cooked sweet potatoes and transfer them to a mixing bowl.
6. Add butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon to the sweet potatoes, and mash until smooth.
7. Transfer the mashed sweet potatoes to a baking dish, top with marshmallows, and bake in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes or until the marshmallows are golden brown.

Note: Adjust the quantities of ingredients according to your preference and the number of servings you want to make.
