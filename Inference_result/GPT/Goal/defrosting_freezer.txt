Action Planning for Defrosting Freezer:

1. Unplug the freezer from the power source to ensure safety.
2. Remove all the items from the freezer and place them in a cooler or another freezer to keep them cold.
3. Open the freezer door and let it thaw naturally for a few hours. You can place towels or a tray underneath to catch any water.
4. Use a plastic scraper or spatula to gently remove any ice buildup on the walls and shelves of the freezer. Avoid using sharp objects that may damage the freezer.
5. Once all the ice has melted, use a damp cloth or sponge to wipe down the interior surfaces of the freezer to remove any residue or water.
6. Dry the interior of the freezer thoroughly using a clean towel or paper towels.
7. Plug the freezer back into the power source and wait for it to reach the desired temperature before returning the items back inside.

Note: The actual time required for defrosting may vary depending on the size and condition of the freezer.
