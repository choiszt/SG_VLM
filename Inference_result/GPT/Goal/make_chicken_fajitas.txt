Sure! Here's a simple 7-step action plan for making chicken fajitas:

1. Gather ingredients: Collect boneless, skinless chicken breasts, bell peppers, onions, fajita seasoning, tortillas, and any desired toppings such as salsa, guacamole, or sour cream.

2. Prepare the chicken: Slice the chicken breasts into thin strips and season them with fajita seasoning. Let the chicken marinate for about 15 minutes.

3. Slice the vegetables: Cut the bell peppers and onions into thin strips.

4. Cook the chicken: Heat a large skillet or frying pan over medium-high heat and add some oil. Cook the marinated chicken strips until they are cooked through and slightly browned. Remove the chicken from the pan and set it aside.

5. Sauté the vegetables: In the same skillet, add a bit more oil if needed and sauté the sliced bell peppers and onions until they are tender-crisp.

6. Combine chicken and vegetables: Return the cooked chicken to the skillet with the sautéed vegetables and toss them together until they are well combined and heated through.

7. Serve: Warm up the tortillas and place a scoop of the chicken and vegetable mixture onto each tortilla. Add desired toppings and roll up the tortillas to form fajitas. Enjoy your homemade chicken fajitas!

Please note that this is just a general outline, and you may need to adjust the steps based on your specific preferences or cooking equipment.
