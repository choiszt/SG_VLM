Action Planning for Chopping an Onion:

1. Gather necessary tools and ingredients:
   - Cutting board
   - Chef's knife
   - Onion

2. Prep the onion:
   - Peel off the outer layer of the onion.
   - Cut off the top and bottom of the onion.

3. Cut the onion in half:
   - Place the onion on the cutting board, cut side down.
   - Use the chef's knife to cut the onion in half vertically.

4. Make horizontal cuts:
   - Keep the onion halves flat on the cutting board.
   - Make horizontal cuts into each onion half, being careful not to cut all the way through. Leave about 1/4 inch from the root end intact.

5. Make vertical cuts:
   - Turn the onion halves onto their sides.
   - Make vertical cuts into each onion half, again being careful not to cut all the way through. Leave about 1/4 inch from the root end intact.

6. Chop the onion:
   - Hold the onion halves together and place them flat on the cutting board.
   - Begin chopping the onion from the top, moving your knife in a rocking motion until you reach the root end. Repeat this process until the entire onion is chopped.

7. Transfer chopped onion to a bowl or storage container and discard any remaining onion scraps.

Note: Always exercise caution when handling sharp objects like knives.
