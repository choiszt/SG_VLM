Planning for Fertilizing a Lawn:

1. Gather the necessary materials: fertilizer, spreader, and protective gloves.
2. Put on the protective gloves to ensure safety.
3. Fill the spreader with the appropriate amount of fertilizer according to the instructions on the package.
4. Start at one corner of the lawn and begin spreading the fertilizer evenly using the spreader, walking in a straight line.
5. Continue walking in parallel lines until the entire lawn is covered with fertilizer.
6. Once finished, carefully empty any remaining fertilizer from the spreader and store it properly.
7. Wash your hands and remove the protective gloves.

Remember to follow any specific instructions provided by the fertilizer manufacturer for best results.
