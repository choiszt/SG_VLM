Sure! Here is a simple 7-step action plan to set up the living room for guests:

1. Clean the room: Start by tidying up the living room, dusting the furniture, and vacuuming the floor to ensure it is clean and presentable.
2. Arrange the seating area: Place the couch, chairs, and coffee table in a way that encourages conversation and provides a comfortable seating arrangement for your guests.
3. Decorate the space: Add decorative elements such as pillows, throws, and artwork to enhance the ambiance of the room and make it inviting.
4. Set up a refreshment station: Prepare a designated area with glasses, a water pitcher, and some snacks or beverages for your guests to enjoy during their visit.
5. Adjust the lighting: Ensure that the room is well-lit by adjusting the curtains or blinds to let in natural light or by turning on lamps or overhead lights as needed.
6. Add some ambiance: Set the mood by playing soft music in the background or lighting scented candles to create a warm and welcoming atmosphere.
7. Double-check the details: Before your guests arrive, make sure everything is in place and functioning properly. Check that the TV, Wi-Fi, and any other entertainment systems are working, and ensure there are enough coasters and additional seating if required.

Remember to adjust the plan according to your specific living room layout and guest preferences.
