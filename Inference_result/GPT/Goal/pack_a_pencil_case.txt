Planning for packing a pencil case:

1. Find a suitable pencil case.
2. Gather all the necessary stationery items, such as pencils, pens, erasers, and rulers.
3. Place the stationery items neatly inside the pencil case.
4. Check if any additional items, such as a sharpener or highlighters, need to be included.
5. Close the pencil case securely to ensure nothing falls out.
6. Put the pencil case in a bag or backpack, if needed.
7. Double-check to make sure everything is packed properly and ready to go.
