Action Planning for Cleaning Plastic Containers:

1. Gather all the plastic containers that need cleaning.
2. Fill a sink or basin with warm soapy water.
3. Place the plastic containers in the soapy water and let them soak for a few minutes.
4. Using a sponge or scrub brush, scrub the inside and outside of each container to remove any food residue or stains.
5. Rinse the containers thoroughly with clean water to remove any soap residue.
6. Allow the containers to air dry completely before stacking or storing them.
7. Once dry, check each container for cleanliness and store them in an organized manner.

Note: If any containers are still not clean after step 5, repeat steps 4 and 5 until they are thoroughly cleaned.
