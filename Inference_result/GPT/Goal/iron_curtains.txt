Action Planning for Ironing Curtains:

1. Gather necessary supplies: iron, ironing board, water spray bottle, and curtains.
2. Set up the ironing board in a well-ventilated area, ensuring it is stable.
3. Fill the water spray bottle with water and set it aside.
4. Plug in and turn on the iron, adjusting the heat settings based on the fabric of the curtains. Allow the iron to heat up.
5. Lay the curtains flat on the ironing board, ensuring there are no wrinkles or folds.
6. Start ironing from the top of the curtains, moving downwards in a smooth and continuous motion. Use the steam function if necessary to remove stubborn wrinkles.
7. Once one side of the curtains is ironed, carefully flip them over and repeat the ironing process on the other side.

Note: It is important to follow the manufacturer's instructions for ironing curtains, especially regarding heat settings and fabric type.
