Action Plan for Storing Food:

1. Collect all the perishable food items from the kitchen.
2. Sort the food items based on their expiration dates.
3. Check the storage area for any available space or empty containers.
4. Arrange the food items in the storage area, placing the ones with the closest expiration dates at the front.
5. Make sure to seal the containers properly to maintain freshness and prevent spoilage.
6. Label each container with the name of the food item and its expiration date.
7. Place the containers in the designated storage area and ensure they are easily accessible for future use.

Note: Remember to handle fragile items with care while storing them.
