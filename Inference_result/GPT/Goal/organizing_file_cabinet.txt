Action Planning for Organizing File Cabinet:

1. Start by emptying out the entire file cabinet.
2. Sort through the documents and separate them into different categories (e.g., financial, personal, work-related).
3. Create folders or labels for each category and place the documents accordingly.
4. Review each document and decide whether it needs to be kept or discarded.
5. Shred or recycle any unnecessary or outdated documents.
6. Arrange the folders or labels in alphabetical or chronological order for easier access.
7. Place the sorted documents back into the file cabinet, ensuring that they are neatly organized and easy to find.

Note: This action plan assumes that the file cabinet is already set up with folders or labels. If not, an additional step of setting up the file cabinet with folders or labels may be required.
