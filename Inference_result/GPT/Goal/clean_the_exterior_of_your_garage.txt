Action Planning:

1. Gather necessary cleaning supplies such as a broom, mop, bucket, soap, and water.
2. Remove any objects or debris from the area around the garage to create a clear workspace.
3. Sweep the exterior of the garage to remove loose dirt and dust.
4. Prepare a mixture of soap and water in the bucket.
5. Dip the mop into the soapy water and scrub the walls and door of the garage, starting from the top and working your way down.
6. Rinse the mop regularly in the bucket to remove excess dirt and soap.
7. Once you have finished cleaning, allow the garage exterior to air dry or use a clean cloth to wipe away any excess moisture.
