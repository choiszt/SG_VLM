Action Planning for cleaning pearls:

1. Gather necessary cleaning supplies such as a soft cloth, mild soap, and warm water.
2. Fill a small bowl with warm water and add a few drops of mild soap.
3. Dip the soft cloth into the soapy water and gently wipe each pearl, ensuring to remove any dirt or residue.
4. Rinse the pearls with clean water to remove any soap residue.
5. Pat the pearls dry with a clean, soft cloth.
6. Lay the pearls flat on a soft cloth or towel to air dry completely.
7. Once dry, store the pearls in a jewelry box or pouch to prevent scratching or damage.

Note: It's important to avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials when cleaning pearls, as they can damage the delicate surface.
