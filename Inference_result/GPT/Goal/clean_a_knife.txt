Planning for cleaning a knife:

1. Gather necessary cleaning supplies such as dish soap, a sponge or brush, and a towel.
2. Fill a sink or basin with warm water and add a small amount of dish soap.
3. Place the knife in the soapy water and let it soak for a few minutes.
4. Use the sponge or brush to scrub the knife, paying attention to any stubborn stains or residue.
5. Rinse the knife thoroughly under running water to remove all soap.
6. Dry the knife with a clean towel or let it air dry.
7. Store the clean knife in a safe place or use it as needed.
