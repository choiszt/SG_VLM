Action Planning for Polishing Wood Floors:

1. Gather necessary materials: microfiber mop, wood floor polish, bucket, warm water.
2. Clear the floor of any furniture or obstacles.
3. Sweep or vacuum the floor to remove any dust or debris.
4. Fill the bucket with warm water and add the appropriate amount of wood floor polish according to the manufacturer's instructions.
5. Dip the microfiber mop into the bucket and wring out excess water.
6. Start at one corner of the room and work your way towards the exit, mopping the floor in small sections.
7. Allow the floor to dry completely before moving any furniture back into place.
