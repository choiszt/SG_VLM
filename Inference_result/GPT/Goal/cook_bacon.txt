Action Planning for cooking bacon:

1. Gather ingredients: bacon slices, frying pan, spatula.
2. Heat the frying pan over medium heat.
3. Place the bacon slices in the pan, making sure not to overlap them.
4. Cook the bacon for a few minutes on one side, until it starts to brown.
5. Flip the bacon slices using the spatula and cook for a few more minutes on the other side.
6. Keep an eye on the bacon to prevent it from burning. Adjust the heat if necessary.
7. Once the bacon is crispy and cooked to your liking, remove it from the pan and place it on a paper towel to drain excess grease.

Remember to follow safety precautions while cooking and be careful when handling hot objects. Enjoy your delicious bacon!
