Planning to Clean a Sieve:

1. Gather necessary supplies: a clean bucket, warm water, dish soap, a scrub brush, and a towel.
2. Fill the bucket with warm water and add a few drops of dish soap.
3. Place the sieve in the soapy water and let it soak for a few minutes.
4. Use the scrub brush to gently scrub the sieve, paying extra attention to any areas with stuck-on debris.
5. Rinse the sieve thoroughly with clean water to remove any soap residue.
6. Use the towel to dry the sieve, ensuring it is completely dry before storing or using it again.
7. Clean the surrounding area and put away all the cleaning supplies.
