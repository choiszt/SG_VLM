Action Planning for cooking ground beef:

1. Gather the necessary ingredients and tools: ground beef, cooking oil, onions (optional), garlic (optional), salt, pepper, and a frying pan.

2. Heat the frying pan over medium heat and add a small amount of cooking oil to prevent sticking.

3. Add the ground beef to the pan and break it up with a spatula or spoon to ensure even cooking.

4. If desired, add diced onions and minced garlic to the pan for added flavor. Stir them in with the ground beef.

5. Cook the ground beef, stirring occasionally, until it is browned and cooked through. This usually takes about 5-7 minutes.

6. Season the ground beef with salt and pepper to taste. Adjust the seasoning according to your preference.

7. Once the ground beef is fully cooked and seasoned, remove it from the heat and drain any excess grease before using it in your desired recipe or dish.

Note: Make sure to follow proper food safety guidelines, such as cooking the ground beef to an internal temperature of 160°F (71°C) to ensure it is fully cooked and safe to eat.
