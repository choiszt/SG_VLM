Action Planning for packing your gym bag:

1. Gather your gym clothes and place them in the bag.
2. Pack your gym shoes and socks in a separate compartment or bag within the main bag.
3. Include a towel and any necessary toiletries, such as a shower gel or deodorant.
4. Don't forget to bring a water bottle and a snack for after your workout.
5. If you use any workout accessories, such as resistance bands or gloves, pack them in the bag as well.
6. Remember to bring your gym membership card or any necessary identification.
7. Double-check that you have everything packed and zip up the bag securely.
