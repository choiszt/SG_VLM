Action Planning for cleaning mushrooms:

1. Gather necessary supplies: a bowl, a clean kitchen towel, and a colander.
2. Fill the bowl with cold water.
3. Place the mushrooms in the colander and rinse them under running water to remove any dirt or debris.
4. Transfer the rinsed mushrooms to the bowl of water and let them soak for a few minutes to loosen any remaining dirt.
5. Gently agitate the mushrooms in the water to ensure all surfaces are cleaned.
6. Lift the mushrooms out of the water and transfer them to the colander to drain.
7. Pat the mushrooms dry with a clean kitchen towel before using or storing them.

Note: It's important to avoid soaking mushrooms for too long, as they can absorb excess water and become mushy.
