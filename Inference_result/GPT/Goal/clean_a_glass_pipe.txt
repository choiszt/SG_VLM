Action Planning for Cleaning a Glass Pipe:
1. Gather necessary materials: isopropyl alcohol, coarse salt, pipe cleaners, and a small container.
2. Fill the small container with isopropyl alcohol.
3. Disassemble the glass pipe if possible, removing any detachable parts.
4. Place the glass pipe and its parts into the small container filled with isopropyl alcohol.
5. Add a generous amount of coarse salt to the container.
6. Gently swirl the glass pipe and its parts in the alcohol and salt mixture for a few minutes, ensuring the solution reaches all areas.
7. Rinse the glass pipe and its parts thoroughly with warm water to remove any remaining alcohol and salt residue. Air dry or use a clean cloth to dry before reassembling, if necessary.
