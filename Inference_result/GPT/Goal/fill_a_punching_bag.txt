Planning to fill a punching bag:

1. Gather the necessary materials: punching bag, filling material (such as sand or cloth scraps), and a funnel (optional).
2. Open the punching bag and locate the opening at the top.
3. If using a funnel, insert it into the opening of the punching bag.
4. Pour the filling material into the punching bag slowly and steadily, ensuring it is evenly distributed.
5. If not using a funnel, carefully hold the opening of the punching bag and pour the filling material directly into it.
6. Continue filling until the punching bag reaches the desired level of firmness.
7. Once filled, securely close the opening of the punching bag, ensuring it is tightly sealed.

Please note that the specific steps may vary depending on the type and design of your punching bag.
