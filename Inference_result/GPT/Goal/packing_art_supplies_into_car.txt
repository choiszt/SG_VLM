Planning for packing art supplies into car:

1. Gather all the art supplies that need to be packed.
2. Find a suitable container or box to store the art supplies.
3. Place the art supplies inside the container, making sure they are secure and won't get damaged during transportation.
4. Check if there are any fragile or delicate items that require extra protection. If so, wrap them in bubble wrap or use cushioning material to prevent any damage.
5. Once all the art supplies are packed, make sure the container is securely closed or sealed to avoid any spills or accidents.
6. Carry the container to the car and open the trunk or designated storage area.
7. Carefully place the container inside the car, ensuring it is stable and won't slide or move during the journey.

Note: Depending on the specific art supplies and the size of your car, you may need to adjust the steps accordingly.
