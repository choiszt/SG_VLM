1. Gather the necessary ingredients and equipment (nuts, baking sheet, oven, salt, optional seasonings).
2. Preheat the oven to the desired temperature (e.g., 350°F or 180°C).
3. Spread the nuts evenly on the baking sheet.
4. Sprinkle salt and any desired seasonings over the nuts for added flavor.
5. Place the baking sheet with the nuts in the preheated oven.
6. Roast the nuts for the recommended time, usually around 10-15 minutes, or until they are golden brown and fragrant. Keep an eye on them to avoid burning.
7. Once done, remove the baking sheet from the oven and allow the nuts to cool before serving or storing. Enjoy your roasted nuts!
