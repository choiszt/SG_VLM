Action Planning for Making a Blended Iced Cappuccino:

1. Gather the necessary ingredients: espresso coffee, milk, ice cubes, sugar (optional), and cappuccino powder or cocoa powder for garnishing.

2. Brew a strong cup of espresso coffee using an espresso machine or a coffee maker.

3. Allow the espresso to cool down to room temperature or place it in the refrigerator for a few minutes to cool it faster.

4. In a blender, add the cooled espresso, a cup of milk, a handful of ice cubes, and sugar (if desired). Adjust the amount of sugar according to your taste preference.

5. Blend the mixture on high speed until it reaches a smooth and frothy consistency.

6. Pour the blended iced cappuccino into a glass or a serving cup.

7. Garnish the top with a sprinkle of cappuccino powder or cocoa powder for an extra touch. Serve and enjoy your refreshing blended iced cappuccino!
