Planning for chopping an onion:

1. Gather necessary ingredients and tools: onion, cutting board, knife.
2. Place the cutting board on a stable surface.
3. Peel the onion, removing the outer layer.
4. Cut off the top and bottom of the onion.
5. Make a vertical cut down the middle of the onion, from top to bottom.
6. Lay the onion halves flat on the cutting board, and make horizontal cuts across the onion, leaving the root intact.
7. Finally, make vertical cuts, perpendicular to the horizontal cuts, to dice the onion.

Remember to exercise caution while handling the knife and follow safety guidelines.
