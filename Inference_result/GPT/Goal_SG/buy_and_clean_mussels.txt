Planning for buying and cleaning mussels:

1. Check for availability: Check if mussels are available at a nearby grocery store or seafood market.
2. Prepare shopping list: Make a list of the ingredients needed for cleaning mussels, including fresh mussels, lemon, water, and salt.
3. Go to the store: Visit the grocery store or seafood market to purchase the required ingredients.
4. Select fresh mussels: Look for mussels that are tightly closed and have no cracks or broken shells.
5. Clean the mussels: Rinse the mussels under cold water to remove any sand or debris. Discard any mussels that do not close after being tapped or those with broken shells.
6. Debeard the mussels: Gently remove the beard, a fibrous membrane, from each mussel using a small knife or your fingers.
7. Store the cleaned mussels: Place the cleaned mussels in a bowl or container, cover with a damp cloth or paper towel, and store them in the refrigerator until ready to cook.

Note: It is important to cook and consume mussels on the same day of purchase for optimal freshness and taste.
