Action Planning for Making Chicken Fajitas:

1. Gather all the necessary ingredients: chicken breasts, bell peppers, onions, fajita seasoning, tortillas, olive oil, and any desired toppings (e.g., salsa, sour cream, guacamole).

2. Preheat a large skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat.

3. Season the chicken breasts with fajita seasoning on both sides.

4. Add a drizzle of olive oil to the preheated skillet or grill pan and cook the chicken breasts for about 6-8 minutes on each side until they are cooked through.

5. While the chicken is cooking, slice the bell peppers and onions into thin strips.

6. Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the skillet or grill pan and let it rest for a few minutes. Then, slice it into thin strips.

7. In the same skillet or grill pan, add a little more olive oil if needed and sauté the bell peppers and onions until they are tender-crisp.

Optional: Warm the tortillas in a separate pan or in the oven.

Now, assemble the chicken fajitas by placing a spoonful of the sautéed bell peppers and onions onto a tortilla, followed by a few slices of the cooked chicken. Add any desired toppings and fold the tortilla to create a fajita.

Enjoy your homemade chicken fajitas!
