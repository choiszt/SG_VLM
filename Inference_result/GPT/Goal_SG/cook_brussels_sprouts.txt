Action Planning for Cooking Brussels Sprouts:

1. Gather ingredients: Brussels sprouts, olive oil, salt, and pepper.
2. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
3. Rinse the Brussels sprouts under cold water and remove any outer leaves that are wilted or damaged.
4. Cut off the woody stem end of each Brussels sprout and slice them in half.
5. Place the halved Brussels sprouts in a mixing bowl and drizzle them with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Toss well to coat.
6. Spread the Brussels sprouts in a single layer on a baking sheet.
7. Roast the Brussels sprouts in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until they are tender and lightly browned.

Note: Cooking times may vary, so keep an eye on the Brussels sprouts and adjust the roasting time if needed. Enjoy your cooked Brussels sprouts!
