Action Plan for Roasting Nuts:

1. Preheat the oven to the desired temperature (usually around 350°F or 180°C).
2. Prepare the nuts by selecting the type you want to roast (such as almonds, cashews, or peanuts) and making sure they are clean and dry.
3. Spread the nuts evenly on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone mat.
4. Place the baking sheet with the nuts in the preheated oven.
5. Set a timer for 5 minutes and check the nuts. Give the baking sheet a shake to ensure even roasting.
6. Continue roasting the nuts for another 5 minutes or until they reach your desired level of golden brown color and aroma. Keep a close eye on them to prevent burning.
7. Once roasted, remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the nuts cool completely before storing them in an airtight container.

Note: The roasting time may vary depending on the type and size of nuts, so adjust the time accordingly. Also, feel free to experiment with different spices or seasonings to add flavor to your roasted nuts.
