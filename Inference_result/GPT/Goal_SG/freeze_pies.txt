Action Planning for Freezing Pies:

1. Prepare the pies: Make sure the pies are cool and ready to be frozen.

2. Wrap the pies: Wrap each pie individually in plastic wrap or aluminum foil to protect them from freezer burn.

3. Label the pies: Use a marker or labels to indicate the type and date of each pie. This will help you identify them later.

4. Place the pies in freezer bags: Place the wrapped pies into freezer-safe bags, removing as much air as possible to prevent freezer burn.

5. Seal the bags: Make sure the bags are properly sealed to keep the pies fresh and prevent any freezer odors from affecting the taste.

6. Arrange the pies in the freezer: Place the bags of pies in a single layer in the freezer, ensuring they are not overcrowded and have enough space to freeze evenly.

7. Set the temperature and time: Adjust the freezer temperature to the recommended setting for freezing pies and allow them to freeze for the recommended time (usually a few hours or overnight).

By following these steps, you should successfully freeze your pies and be able to enjoy them at a later time.
