Action Planning for Ironing Curtains:

1. Gather all the necessary supplies: iron, ironing board, water spray bottle, and curtains.
2. Set up the ironing board in a spacious area, ensuring it is stable and secure.
3. Plug in the iron and adjust the temperature according to the fabric of the curtains.
4. Hang the curtains on the ironing board, making sure they are spread out and not overlapping.
5. Spray a light mist of water on the curtains to dampen the fabric slightly, making it easier to remove wrinkles.
6. Starting from the top, slowly and carefully iron the curtains in long, straight strokes, working your way down. Pay attention to any pleats or folds and iron them separately.
7. Once one side is complete, flip the curtains over and repeat the ironing process on the other side. Check for any missed wrinkles and touch up as needed.

Remember to always follow safety precautions while ironing and unplug the iron after use.
