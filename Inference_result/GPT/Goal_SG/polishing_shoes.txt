Action Planning for Polishing Shoes:

1. Gather cleaning supplies: Find a soft cloth or brush, shoe polish, and a shoe polish applicator.
2. Prepare the shoes: Remove any dirt or debris from the shoes by wiping them with a damp cloth or brushing them gently.
3. Apply shoe polish: Take a small amount of shoe polish on the applicator and apply it evenly to the surface of the shoes. Use circular motions to work the polish into the leather.
4. Let the polish dry: Allow the shoe polish to dry for a few minutes. This will help the polish to penetrate the leather and provide a better shine.
5. Buff the shoes: Use the soft cloth or brush to buff the shoes. Apply light pressure and make quick back-and-forth motions to create a shine.
6. Repeat if necessary: If the shoes don't have the desired shine, repeat steps 3-5 to apply another layer of shoe polish and buff again.
7. Store the supplies: Clean the cloth or brush and store them in a designated place for future use.

Note: It's important to follow the instructions on the shoe polish packaging and consider the specific instructions for the type of shoes you are polishing.
