Action Planning for cleaning fur:

1. Gather necessary cleaning supplies such as a brush, pet shampoo, and towels.
2. Fill a basin or sink with warm water and add a small amount of pet shampoo.
3. Gently wet the fur of the pet using a spray bottle or by pouring water over them.
4. Apply a small amount of pet shampoo to the fur and gently massage it in, avoiding the eyes and ears.
5. Rinse the fur thoroughly with clean water, making sure to remove all the shampoo.
6. Use a clean towel to gently pat the fur dry, removing any excess water.
7. Brush the fur to remove any tangles or mats and leave it looking clean and neat.

Note: It is important to always follow the specific instructions and guidelines provided by the manufacturer of the pet shampoo. Additionally, make sure to use pet-friendly and non-toxic products suitable for the specific type of fur and pet you are cleaning.
