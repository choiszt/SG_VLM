Action Plan for Freezing Fruit:

1. Gather the fruit you want to freeze.
2. Wash the fruit thoroughly to remove any dirt or debris.
3. Peel and cut the fruit into desired sizes or shapes, if necessary.
4. Lay the fruit pieces on a flat tray or baking sheet, making sure they are not touching each other.
5. Place the tray with the fruit in the freezer and let it freeze for a few hours or until the fruit is completely frozen.
6. Transfer the frozen fruit pieces into freezer-safe containers or bags, ensuring they are properly sealed to prevent freezer burn.
7. Label the containers or bags with the name and date of the fruit, and place them back in the freezer for long-term storage.

Note: The freezing time may vary depending on the type and size of the fruit. It is also recommended to consult specific freezing instructions for different fruits to ensure the best results.
