Action Planning to Hang a Bike on the Wall:

1. Gather necessary tools and materials: drill, screws, screwdriver, bike hooks, measuring tape.
2. Measure the height and width of the bike to determine the appropriate position on the wall.
3. Mark the desired position on the wall for the bike hooks.
4. Use the drill and screws to attach the bike hooks securely to the wall.
5. Lift the bike onto the hooks, ensuring it is stable and properly aligned.
6. Double-check the hooks and the bike's stability before letting go.
7. Test the bike by gently tugging on it to ensure it is securely hung on the wall.
