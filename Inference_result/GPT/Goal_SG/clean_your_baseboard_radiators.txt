Planning for cleaning baseboard radiators:

1. Gather cleaning supplies: Get a vacuum cleaner, a soft brush or cloth, and a bucket of warm soapy water.
2. Turn off the heating system: Make sure the baseboard radiators are not hot before cleaning to avoid burns.
3. Vacuum the radiators: Use the vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment to remove any loose dirt, dust, or debris from the radiator fins and grills.
4. Wipe down the radiators: Dip the soft brush or cloth in the warm soapy water and gently clean the radiator surfaces, paying attention to the hard-to-reach areas.
5. Rinse and wring out the cloth: Rinse the cloth in clean water and wring out the excess moisture.
6. Wipe off the soap residue: Use the damp cloth to wipe off any soap residue from the radiator surfaces.
7. Allow the radiators to dry: Leave the radiators to air dry completely before turning on the heating system again.

Remember to always follow safety precautions and refer to the manufacturer's instructions if available.
