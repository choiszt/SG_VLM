Planning for storing firewood outdoors:

1. Gather necessary tools and materials: gloves, wheelbarrow, tarp or cover, and firewood rack.
2. Choose a suitable location for the firewood storage, preferably away from the house and in a well-drained area.
3. Clear the chosen area of any debris, rocks, or obstacles that may hinder the storage process.
4. Lay down a tarp or cover on the ground to prevent moisture from seeping into the firewood.
5. Start stacking the firewood on the rack, ensuring that it is stable and evenly distributed.
6. Cover the stacked firewood with a tarp or cover to protect it from rain, snow, and other elements.
7. Periodically check the firewood stack to ensure it remains stable and protected, making adjustments or adding more covers as needed.
