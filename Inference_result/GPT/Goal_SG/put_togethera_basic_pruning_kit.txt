Action Planning for Putting Together a Basic Pruning Kit:

1. Gather necessary tools:
   - Pruning shears
   - Hand pruners
   - Loppers (optional)
   - Pruning saw (optional)
   - Gardening gloves
   - Safety goggles (optional)

2. Find a suitable container or bag to hold the tools. It can be a small toolbox or a gardening tote.

3. Organize the tools in the container:
   - Place the pruning shears and hand pruners in separate compartments or pockets.
   - If using loppers or a pruning saw, securely store them in the container as well.
   - Keep the gardening gloves and safety goggles easily accessible.

4. Check the condition of each tool:
   - Ensure the blades of the pruning shears and hand pruners are sharp and clean.
   - If any tool is damaged or requires maintenance, set it aside for repair or replacement.

5. Securely close the container or bag to prevent any tools from falling out during transportation.

6. Find a suitable storage location for the pruning kit:
   - Choose a place where it is easily accessible, such as a gardening shed or garage.
   - Make sure it is kept away from children or pets to ensure their safety.

7. Regularly maintain and clean the tools:
   - After each use, wipe down the blades with a clean cloth.
   - Apply a light coating of oil to prevent rusting.
   - Store the pruning kit in a dry and well-ventilated area to prolong its lifespan.

Note: Remember to always follow safety guidelines while using pruning tools and wear appropriate protective gear.
