1. Empty the contents of the backpack.
2. Shake out any loose dirt or debris from the backpack.
3. Fill a basin or sink with warm water and add a small amount of mild detergent.
4. Use a soft brush or cloth to gently scrub the exterior of the backpack, paying extra attention to any stains or dirty areas.
5. Rinse the backpack thoroughly with clean water to remove any soap residue.
6. Hang the backpack upside down to air dry, preferably in a well-ventilated area.
