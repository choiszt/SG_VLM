Action Planning for preparing a sea salt soak:

1. Gather necessary materials: sea salt, warm water, a basin or tub, and a towel.
2. Fill the basin or tub with warm water, ensuring it is at a comfortable temperature.
3. Add sea salt to the warm water, stirring gently until it dissolves. Use approximately 1/4 to 1/2 cup of sea salt, depending on your preference.
4. Place the towel nearby to use after the soak.
5. Test the water temperature to ensure it is still comfortable before immersing your feet or body.
6. Soak your feet or body in the sea salt solution for 15-20 minutes, allowing the salt to dissolve and the warm water to soothe any sore muscles or joints.
7. After the soak, pat your feet or body dry with the towel and moisturize if desired.

Note: Remember to consult a medical professional if you have any skin conditions or allergies before using a sea salt soak.
