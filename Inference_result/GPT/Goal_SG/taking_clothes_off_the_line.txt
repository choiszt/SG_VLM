Sure! Here's a simple 7-step plan for taking clothes off the line:

1. Gather a clothes basket or bag.
2. Approach the clothesline and ensure it is safe to access.
3. Begin by unclipping the first piece of clothing from the line.
4. Fold or shake out the clothing item to remove any dust or debris.
5. Place the clothing item in the clothes basket or bag.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 for each remaining item on the clothesline.
7. Once all clothes are removed, carry the basket or bag indoors and proceed with folding or storing the clothes as needed.

Remember to exercise caution and be mindful of any specific instructions or requirements for handling delicate or special garments.
