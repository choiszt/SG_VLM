Action Planning for washing towels:

1. Sort the towels: Separate the towels based on color or fabric type to avoid color bleeding or damage.
2. Pre-treat stains: Check each towel for any stains and apply a suitable stain remover or detergent directly on the stained areas. Allow it to sit for a few minutes.
3. Load the washing machine: Place the towels in the washing machine, making sure not to overload it. Add the appropriate amount of laundry detergent.
4. Select the appropriate wash cycle: Choose a cycle that is suitable for towels, such as a heavy-duty or towel-specific cycle, to ensure proper cleaning.
5. Start the washing machine: Close the machine's door and start the wash cycle.
6. Dry the towels: After the wash cycle is complete, transfer the towels to a dryer or hang them on a clothesline to dry. Adjust the settings on the dryer based on the fabric type of the towels.
7. Fold and put away: Once the towels are completely dry, fold them neatly and put them away in the designated storage area.

Note: If you do not have a washing machine or dryer, you can adapt the plan by washing the towels by hand in a basin or bathtub and air-drying them.
