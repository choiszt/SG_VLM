Action Planning for Hanging Paper Lanterns:

1. Gather all the paper lanterns and the necessary materials like string or wire.
2. Identify the desired locations to hang the lanterns.
3. Measure the appropriate length of string or wire needed for each lantern.
4. Attach one end of the string or wire to the top loop of a lantern.
5. Securely attach the other end of the string or wire to a hook or nail on the ceiling or wall, depending on the desired location.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for each paper lantern, ensuring they are evenly spaced and at the desired height.
7. Once all the lanterns are hung, adjust their positions if needed to achieve the desired aesthetic.

Note: Ensure that the chosen hooks or nails are strong enough to support the weight of the lanterns.
