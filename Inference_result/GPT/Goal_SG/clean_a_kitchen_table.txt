Action Plan for cleaning a kitchen table:

1. Gather cleaning supplies (such as a cleaning solution, microfiber cloth, and gloves).
2. Remove any items from the table (such as dishes or utensils) and place them aside.
3. Wipe down the table surface with a damp cloth to remove any loose dirt or debris.
4. Apply the cleaning solution to the cloth and thoroughly clean the table surface, paying attention to any stubborn stains or spills.
5. Rinse the cloth and wipe down the table again to remove any residue from the cleaning solution.
6. Dry the table surface with a clean, dry cloth to ensure it is completely dry.
7. Return the items back to the table once it is dry and clean.

Note: Please make sure to follow any specific instructions provided by the manufacturer of the cleaning solution or any other cleaning products used.
