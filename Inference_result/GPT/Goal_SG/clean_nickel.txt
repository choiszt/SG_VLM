Action Planning for cleaning a nickel:

1. Gather necessary cleaning supplies such as a soft cloth, mild soap, and warm water.
2. Wet the cloth with warm water and apply a small amount of mild soap.
3. Gently rub the nickel with the soapy cloth in circular motions to remove any dirt or grime.
4. Rinse the cloth with clean water and wring out any excess moisture.
5. Use the damp cloth to wipe away any soap residue from the nickel.
6. Dry the nickel thoroughly with a clean, dry cloth to prevent water spots.
7. Optionally, apply a thin layer of metal polish or a specialized nickel cleaner to restore shine and protect the surface.

Note: Before starting the cleaning process, it's important to ensure that the nickel item is safe to be cleaned with the chosen method. Some items may require specific cleaning instructions or professional care.
