Action Plan for Packing a Pencil Case:

1. Gather all necessary supplies, such as a pencil case, pencils, pens, erasers, and any other desired stationery items.
2. Open the pencil case and clear out any existing contents.
3. Sort and organize the stationery items based on their size and function.
4. Place the larger items, such as pencils and pens, at the bottom of the pencil case.
5. Arrange the smaller items, such as erasers and sharpeners, on top of the larger items.
6. Check if there is any remaining space in the pencil case and add any additional stationery items if desired.
7. Close the pencil case securely, ensuring that all items are properly stored inside.

Note: This action plan assumes that the pencil case is empty at the beginning.
