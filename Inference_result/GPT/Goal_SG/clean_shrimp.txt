Sure! Here is a simple action plan to clean shrimp:

1. Gather necessary materials: a bowl, a colander, a knife, and a cutting board.
2. Fill the bowl with cold water.
3. Place the shrimp in the colander and rinse them under running water to remove any dirt or debris.
4. Use the knife to carefully remove the shells and tails of the shrimp.
5. Make a shallow cut along the back of each shrimp to remove the vein, if desired.
6. Rinse the shrimp once again under cold water to remove any remaining impurities.
7. Pat the shrimp dry with a paper towel or let them air dry before using them in your recipe.

Remember to always wash your hands before and after handling raw seafood.
