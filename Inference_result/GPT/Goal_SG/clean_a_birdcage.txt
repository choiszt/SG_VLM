Action Planning for Cleaning a Birdcage:

1. Gather cleaning supplies: Prepare a bucket, cleaning solution, scrub brush, and gloves.
2. Remove the bird from the cage: Carefully take the bird out of the cage and place it in a safe area.
3. Empty the cage: Remove any toys, perches, and food/water dishes from the cage.
4. Disassemble the cage: Take apart any removable parts of the cage, such as trays or grates.
5. Clean the cage: Use the scrub brush and cleaning solution to thoroughly clean all surfaces of the cage, including bars, trays, and perches.
6. Rinse and dry the cage: Rinse off the cleaning solution with water and use a towel or air-dry the cage to ensure it is completely dry.
7. Reassemble the cage and return the bird: Put back all the removable parts of the cage and place the bird back inside with fresh toys, perches, and food/water dishes.

Note: Ensure the bird is safe and secure during the cleaning process and avoid using any toxic cleaning products that may harm the bird.
