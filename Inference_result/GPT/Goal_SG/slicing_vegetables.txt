3. Place the vegetables on a clean cutting board.
4. Hold the knife firmly and position it at a comfortable angle.
5. Start slicing the vegetables one at a time, using a smooth and controlled motion.
6. Continue slicing until all the vegetables are cut into desired sizes or shapes.
7. Clean the cutting board and knife after use, and store them properly.
