Planning for cooking bacon:

1. Gather the necessary ingredients: bacon slices, frying pan, spatula.
2. Place the frying pan on the stove and turn the heat to medium.
3. Place the bacon slices in the frying pan, making sure they are spread out and not overlapping.
4. Cook the bacon for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until it reaches your desired level of crispiness.
5. Use the spatula to carefully flip the bacon slices to cook the other side.
6. Continue cooking until all the bacon slices are crispy and cooked to your liking.
7. Remove the cooked bacon from the pan and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to drain off any excess grease. 

Please note that cooking times may vary, so keep an eye on the bacon to prevent it from burning.
