Action Planning:
1. Gather the necessary ingredients: yams, butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and marshmallows.
2. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
3. Wash and peel the yams, then cut them into cubes.
4. In a pot, boil the yam cubes until they are tender.
5. Drain the yam cubes and transfer them to a baking dish.
6. Add butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon to the yams, and mix well.
7. Top the yams with a layer of marshmallows and bake in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes, or until the marshmallows are golden brown and melted.

Note: The cooking time may vary, so it's important to keep an eye on the yams while they are baking.
