Planning for cleaning greens:

1. Gather cleaning supplies such as a bucket, water, and a mild detergent.
2. Fill the bucket with water and add the mild detergent according to the instructions.
3. Remove any visible dirt or debris from the greens by gently rinsing them under running water.
4. Place the greens in the prepared bucket of soapy water and let them soak for a few minutes.
5. After soaking, gently agitate the greens in the soapy water to remove any remaining dirt or residue.
6. Rinse the greens thoroughly under running water to remove the soap and any loosened debris.
7. Pat the greens dry with a clean towel or use a salad spinner to remove excess water before storing or using.
