Planning for chlorinating the pool:

1. Gather the necessary supplies: chlorine tablets, pool skimmer, and protective gloves.
2. Put on the protective gloves to ensure safety while handling the chlorine tablets.
3. Use the pool skimmer to remove any debris or leaves from the surface of the pool.
4. Place the required number of chlorine tablets in the pool skimmer or a floating dispenser.
5. Distribute the chlorine tablets evenly across the pool to ensure proper chlorination.
6. Allow the chlorine tablets to dissolve and circulate in the pool water for at least 30 minutes.
7. After the designated time, remove the pool skimmer or floating dispenser and store it properly.

Note: It is important to read and follow the instructions on the chlorine tablets packaging for specific dosage and usage guidelines.
