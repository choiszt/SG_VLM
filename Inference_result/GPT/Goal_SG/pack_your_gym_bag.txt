Action Plan for Packing Your Gym Bag:

1. Gather all necessary items for the gym bag: gym clothes, workout shoes, towel, water bottle, and any other personal items you may need.
2. Lay out the gym bag in a convenient location.
3. Fold and place the gym clothes neatly inside the bag.
4. Place the workout shoes in a separate compartment or wrap them in a plastic bag to keep them from dirtying other items.
5. Roll up the towel and place it on top of the clothes or in a designated pocket.
6. Put the water bottle in an outside pocket or secure it inside the bag to prevent leaking.
7. Check if there are any additional personal items you want to bring, such as headphones or a lock, and add them to the bag.

Remember to double-check that you have everything you need before closing the bag!
