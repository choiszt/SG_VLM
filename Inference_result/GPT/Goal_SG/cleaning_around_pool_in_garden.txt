Action Planning for Cleaning Around Pool in the Garden:

1. Gather cleaning supplies: 
   - Pool skimmer 
   - Leaf rake 
   - Pool brush 
   - Pool vacuum 

2. Remove any large debris from the pool using the pool skimmer and leaf rake. 
   - Skim the surface of the water to remove leaves, insects, and any floating debris. 
   - Use the leaf rake to remove any debris that has sunk to the bottom of the pool. 

3. Brush the pool walls and floor to remove any algae or dirt buildup. 
   - Start at one end of the pool and work your way around, using the pool brush to scrub the walls and floor. 
   - Pay special attention to areas with visible dirt or algae growth. 

4. Use the pool vacuum to clean the pool floor. 
   - Attach the pool vacuum to the pool's filtration system or use a standalone pool vacuum if available. 
   - Slowly move the vacuum across the pool floor, making sure to cover the entire surface area. 

5. Clean the pool filter and skimmer basket. 
   - Turn off the pool pump before removing the filter and skimmer basket. 
   - Rinse both the filter and skimmer basket with water to remove any debris. 
   - Replace the filter and skimmer basket back into their respective positions. 

6. Check and adjust the pool's chemical levels if necessary. 
   - Test the water using a pool water testing kit to check the chlorine, pH, and alkalinity levels. 
   - Adjust the chemical levels as needed to maintain a clean and balanced pool. 

7. Dispose of any collected debris and tidy up the pool area. 
   - Empty the pool skimmer and leaf rake into a trash bag or compost pile. 
   - Store all cleaning supplies in a designated area and ensure the pool area is clean and organized.
