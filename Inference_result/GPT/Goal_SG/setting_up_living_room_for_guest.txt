Planning for setting up the living room for guests:

1. Clean the living room: Remove any clutter, dust surfaces, and vacuum the floor.
2. Arrange seating: Place the chairs and sofas in a comfortable and inviting arrangement.
3. Add decorative touches: Place some throw pillows, blankets, and decorative items on the furniture.
4. Set up a coffee table: Place a coffee table in the center of the seating area and add some coasters.
5. Provide entertainment: Set up a TV or music system and ensure it is working properly.
6. Adjust lighting: Make sure the room is well-lit by turning on the lights or opening curtains.
7. Add finishing touches: Place fresh flowers or scented candles to create a pleasant atmosphere.

Note: The specific steps may vary depending on the current state of your living room and your personal preferences.
