Action Plan:
1. Gather all cleaning supplies that need to be packed into the car.
2. Organize the supplies into categories, such as cleaning solutions, brushes, mops, and rags.
3. Find a suitable container or bag to pack the supplies into. Make sure it is large enough to hold all the items.
4. Start with the larger items, such as mops and brooms, and place them in the container first.
5. Next, add the smaller items, such as brushes and rags, to fill in any gaps.
6. Double-check that all the cleaning supplies have been packed into the container and nothing has been left behind.
7. Secure the container in the car, making sure it won't shift or tip over during transportation.
