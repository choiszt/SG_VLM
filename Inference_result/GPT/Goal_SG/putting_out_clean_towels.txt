Action Planning for Putting Out Clean Towels:

1. Gather clean towels from the laundry room or linen closet.
2. Fold the towels neatly to make them easier to carry.
3. Carry the folded towels to the designated area where they are usually kept, such as a bathroom or linen cabinet.
4. Open the cabinet or towel storage area.
5. Place the folded towels inside the cabinet or on the shelves, arranging them neatly and making sure they are easily accessible.
6. Close the cabinet or storage area to keep the towels organized and protected.
7. If necessary, inform the user that the clean towels are now available for use.
