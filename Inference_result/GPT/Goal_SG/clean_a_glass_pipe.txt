Planning for cleaning a glass pipe:

1. Gather necessary supplies: gloves, rubbing alcohol, pipe cleaners, and a small bowl.

2. Put on the gloves to protect your hands.

3. Pour some rubbing alcohol into the small bowl.

4. Dip a pipe cleaner into the rubbing alcohol and gently scrub the inside of the glass pipe to remove residue and buildup.

5. Repeat step 4 with additional pipe cleaners until the inside of the pipe is clean.

6. Take a clean pipe cleaner and dip it into the rubbing alcohol again. Use it to clean the outside of the glass pipe, removing any dirt or grime.

7. Rinse the glass pipe with warm water to remove any remaining alcohol residue, and let it dry before use.
