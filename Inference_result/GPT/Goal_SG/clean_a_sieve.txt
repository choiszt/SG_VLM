Action Planning for cleaning a sieve:

1. Gather necessary materials: dish soap, scrub brush, sponge, and a clean towel.
2. Fill a sink or basin with warm water and add a small amount of dish soap.
3. Place the sieve in the soapy water and let it soak for a few minutes to loosen any debris.
4. Use a scrub brush or sponge to gently scrub the sieve, paying attention to any areas with stuck-on residue.
5. Rinse the sieve thoroughly under running water to remove all soap and debris.
6. Use a clean towel to dry the sieve completely before storing or using it again.
7. Dispose of the soapy water and clean the sink or basin used for soaking the sieve.

Note: Make sure to handle the sieve with care to avoid damaging the delicate mesh.
