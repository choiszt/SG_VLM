Planning to Fertilize a Lawn:

1. Gather necessary supplies: fertilizer, spreader, gloves, and watering can.
2. Check the weather forecast to ensure optimal conditions for fertilizing.
3. Prepare the lawn by removing any debris, such as twigs or leaves.
4. Fill the spreader with the appropriate amount of fertilizer according to the manufacturer's instructions.
5. Begin spreading the fertilizer evenly across the lawn, starting from one corner and working your way towards the opposite corner.
6. After spreading the fertilizer, water the lawn thoroughly to help activate and distribute the fertilizer.
7. Clean and store the tools properly for future use.

Note: Make sure to follow the instructions on the fertilizer packaging and take any necessary safety precautions while handling chemicals.
