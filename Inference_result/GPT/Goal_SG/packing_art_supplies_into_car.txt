Planning for packing art supplies into the car:

1. Gather all the art supplies in one central location.
2. Sort and organize the supplies based on their size and fragility.
3. Prepare a box or bag to hold the supplies.
4. Place the larger and sturdier supplies at the bottom of the box or bag.
5. Carefully pack the smaller and more fragile supplies on top, using bubble wrap or tissue paper for added protection.
6. Close the box or secure the bag to prevent any items from falling out during transportation.
7. Place the packed art supplies in the car, ensuring they are secure and won't shift during the journey.

Note: Please make sure to consider the size and weight of the art supplies when packing, and adjust the steps accordingly.
