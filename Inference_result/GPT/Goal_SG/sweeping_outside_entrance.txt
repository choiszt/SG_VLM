Action Planning for Sweeping Outside Entrance:

1. Gather necessary cleaning supplies: broom, dustpan, and a trash bag.
2. Put on appropriate protective gear, such as gloves and a mask.
3. Start sweeping from the furthest corner of the entrance towards the exit, making sure to cover the entire area.
4. Use the broom to collect any loose debris, leaves, or dirt into a pile.
5. Carefully use the dustpan to scoop up the debris and transfer it into the trash bag.
6. Dispose of the trash bag in the appropriate garbage bin or designated area.
7. Once the area is clear of debris, use a wet mop or hose to clean the entrance floor if necessary.

Note: Adjust the plan according to the specific requirements and conditions of the outside entrance area.
