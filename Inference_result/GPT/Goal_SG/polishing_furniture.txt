Action Planning for Polishing Furniture:

1. Gather necessary supplies: 
   - Furniture polish 
   - Soft cloth or microfiber cloth 
   - Protective gloves (optional)

2. Dust the furniture: 
   - Use a dry cloth to remove any loose dust or debris from the surface of the furniture. 

3. Apply furniture polish: 
   - Spray a small amount of furniture polish onto the cloth. 
   - Avoid spraying directly onto the furniture to prevent excess polish buildup. 

4. Polish the furniture: 
   - Using the cloth, gently rub the furniture in circular motions. 
   - Pay attention to any areas with stains or marks, and apply a bit more pressure if needed. 

5. Remove excess polish: 
   - After polishing, use a clean part of the cloth to wipe away any excess polish from the furniture. 

6. Repeat if necessary: 
   - If the furniture requires additional polishing, repeat steps 3 to 5 until the desired shine is achieved. 

7. Dispose of materials and clean up: 
   - Properly dispose of any used materials or empty polish containers. 
   - Store the cloth and polish in a designated area for future use.
