Planning for cooking red peppers:

1. Gather the ingredients: red peppers, olive oil, salt, and pepper.
2. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
3. Wash the red peppers and cut them in half lengthwise. Remove the seeds and stems.
4. Place the red pepper halves on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.
5. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and roast the red peppers for about 20-25 minutes, or until they are tender and slightly charred.
6. Remove the red peppers from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes.
7. Serve the roasted red peppers as a side dish or use them in other recipes like salads, sandwiches, or pasta dishes.

Note: Always exercise caution when working with hot ovens or stoves.
