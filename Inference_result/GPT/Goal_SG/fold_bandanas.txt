Sure! Here is a simple 7-step action plan for folding bandanas:

1. Gather all the bandanas that need to be folded.
2. Lay out a clean and flat surface, such as a table or countertop, to work on.
3. Take one bandana and unfold it completely, spreading it out flat on the surface.
4. Fold the bandana in half diagonally, matching opposite corners and creating a triangle shape.
5. Starting from the long side of the triangle, fold the bandana inwards in small sections, creating a long strip.
6. Continue folding the strip until you reach the end, creating a compact folded bandana.
7. Repeat steps 3-6 for each additional bandana, and then neatly stack the folded bandanas for storage or display.

Remember to take your time and be careful while folding to ensure a neat and organized result.
