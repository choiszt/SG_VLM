Action Planning for Scrubbing Bathroom Floor:

1. Gather necessary supplies: Gather a bucket, mop, scrub brush, and a cleaning solution suitable for bathroom floors.

2. Prepare the floor: Remove any obstacles or mats from the bathroom floor. Sweep or vacuum the floor to remove loose dirt and debris.

3. Mix the cleaning solution: Follow the instructions on the cleaning solution to dilute it with water in the bucket. Ensure the solution is mixed well.

4. Dip the mop in the cleaning solution: Dip the mop into the bucket with the cleaning solution, making sure it is fully saturated.

5. Scrub the floor: Start scrubbing the bathroom floor using the mop and apply firm pressure to remove any stains or dirt. Pay extra attention to corners, grout lines, and hard-to-reach areas.

6. Rinse the mop: Rinse the mop thoroughly in clean water to remove any dirt or residue. Squeeze out excess water from the mop.

7. Let the floor dry: Allow the bathroom floor to air dry or use a clean, dry mop or towel to dry it if needed. Ensure the floor is completely dry before using the bathroom again.

Note: Remember to always follow the manufacturer's instructions on cleaning solutions and tools, and take necessary safety precautions like wearing gloves or using proper ventilation while cleaning.
