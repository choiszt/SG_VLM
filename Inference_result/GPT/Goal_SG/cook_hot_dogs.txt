1. Gather necessary ingredients: hot dogs, buns, condiments (ketchup, mustard, etc.).
2. Preheat a skillet or grill pan over medium heat.
3. Place the hot dogs onto the skillet or grill pan and cook for 5-7 minutes, turning occasionally, until they are heated through and have grill marks.
4. While the hot dogs are cooking, toast the buns on a separate skillet or in a toaster if desired.
5. Once the hot dogs are cooked, remove them from the skillet or grill pan and place them into the toasted buns.
6. Add desired condiments to the hot dogs, such as ketchup, mustard, relish, onions, or sauerkraut.
7. Serve the hot dogs immediately and enjoy!
