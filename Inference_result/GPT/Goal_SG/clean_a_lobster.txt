Action Planning for Cleaning a Lobster:

1. Put on protective gloves and apron.
2. Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil.
3. Carefully place the live lobster into the boiling water and cover the pot.
4. Let the lobster boil for about 8-10 minutes, or until the shell turns bright red.
5. Use tongs to remove the lobster from the pot and place it on a cutting board.
6. Use a sharp knife or kitchen shears to carefully cut open the lobster shell, starting from the tail to the head.
7. Remove the meat from the shell, and clean any remaining innards or organs.

Note: It is important to handle live lobsters with caution and follow proper safety guidelines.
