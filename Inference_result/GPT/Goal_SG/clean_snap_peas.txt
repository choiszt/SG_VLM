Action Planning for Cleaning Snap Peas:

1. Gather the necessary cleaning supplies such as a colander, a bowl, and a clean towel.
2. Fill the bowl with cold water and place the snap peas in it.
3. Swirl the snap peas in the water to remove any dirt or debris.
4. Transfer the snap peas to the colander and rinse them under running water to ensure they are thoroughly cleaned.
5. Shake off any excess water from the snap peas and place them on the clean towel to dry.
6. Once the snap peas are dry, transfer them to a storage container or use them for cooking as desired.
7. Clean and dry the colander, bowl, and towel for future use.

Note: Please ensure that you follow proper food safety guidelines and wash your hands before and after handling the snap peas.
