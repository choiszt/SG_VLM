Action Planning for "Putting Laundry in Drawer":

1. Pick up a load of clean laundry from the laundry basket.
2. Open the drawer where you want to put the laundry.
3. Fold or neatly stack the clothes before putting them in the drawer.
4. Place the folded or stacked clothes into the drawer, starting with larger items at the bottom and smaller items on top.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 until all the laundry is in the drawer.
6. Close the drawer securely to ensure the clothes won't fall out.
7. Return the empty laundry basket to its designated spot.

Note: If the laundry is already folded and sorted, you can skip step 3 and directly proceed to step 4.
