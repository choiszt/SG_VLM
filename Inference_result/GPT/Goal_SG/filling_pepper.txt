Planning for filling pepper:

1. Gather the necessary ingredients and tools: pepper, filling mixture (e.g., minced meat or vegetables), a knife, a spoon, and a cooking pan.

2. Wash the pepper thoroughly under running water to remove any dirt or impurities.

3. Cut off the top of the pepper and remove the seeds and white membrane inside.

4. Prepare the filling mixture by combining the desired ingredients in a bowl. Mix well to ensure even distribution of flavors.

5. Spoon the filling mixture into the hollowed-out peppers, ensuring that they are evenly filled.

6. Place the filled peppers in a cooking pan and cover with a lid.

7. Cook the peppers on medium heat for approximately 15-20 minutes or until the filling is cooked through and the peppers are tender.

Note: Cooking times may vary depending on the size and type of pepper. Always check for doneness before serving. Enjoy your filled peppers!
