Action Plan for Cleaning Tennis Balls:

1. Gather all the tennis balls that need to be cleaned.
2. Fill a bucket or basin with warm soapy water.
3. Place the tennis balls into the water and let them soak for a few minutes.
4. Use a soft brush or cloth to scrub each tennis ball, removing any dirt or debris.
5. Rinse the tennis balls under running water to remove the soap.
6. Dry the tennis balls thoroughly using a towel or by air-drying them.
7. Once dry, store the clean tennis balls in a clean container or bag until they are ready to be used again.
