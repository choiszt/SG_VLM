Action Plan for Fertilizing the Garden:

1. Gather necessary materials: gather a bag of fertilizer, gardening gloves, and a watering can.
2. Prepare the soil: remove any weeds or debris from the garden bed and loosen the soil with a garden fork or shovel.
3. Measure and apply fertilizer: follow the instructions on the fertilizer package to determine the appropriate amount for your garden size. Sprinkle the fertilizer evenly over the soil.
4. Mix fertilizer into the soil: use a garden fork or rake to gently mix the fertilizer into the top layer of soil, ensuring it is evenly distributed.
5. Water the garden: fill the watering can with water and evenly water the garden bed, ensuring the fertilizer is thoroughly soaked into the soil.
6. Clean up: gather any leftover fertilizer, weeds, or debris and dispose of them properly.
7. Store tools: clean and store the gardening gloves, watering can, and other tools in a designated area for future use.

Note: It is important to follow the specific instructions on the fertilizer package and take any necessary precautions to ensure the safety of yourself and the environment.
