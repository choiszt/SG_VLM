Action Planning to Wash Lettuce:

1. Fill a large bowl or basin with cold water.
2. Place the lettuce in the water and gently swish it around to remove any dirt or debris.
3. Let the lettuce sit in the water for a few minutes to allow any remaining dirt to sink to the bottom.
4. Lift the lettuce out of the water and transfer it to a colander or strainer.
5. Rinse the lettuce under running water, using your hands to gently rub the leaves to remove any remaining dirt.
6. Shake off any excess water from the lettuce and pat it dry with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels.
7. Your lettuce is now washed and ready to be used in your recipe or stored in the refrigerator.
