Action Planning for Carrying Out Garden Furniture:

1. Gather necessary tools: Gather a screwdriver, wrench, and any other tools needed to assemble or disassemble the garden furniture.

2. Prepare the area: Clear the area where the garden furniture will be placed. Remove any obstacles or debris that may hinder the process.

3. Disassemble the furniture (if needed): If the furniture is currently assembled, carefully disassemble it using the appropriate tools. Keep track of all the parts and hardware.

4. Move the furniture: Lift or carry the disassembled furniture to the desired location. Be cautious to avoid any damage or injury.

5. Reassemble the furniture (if needed): If the furniture needs to be reassembled, follow the manufacturer's instructions or use your prior knowledge to correctly put it back together. Use the tools gathered in step 1.

6. Arrange the furniture: Once the furniture is assembled or moved, arrange it in the desired position in the garden. Make sure it is stable and level.

7. Clean up and organize: After completing the task, clean up any tools, packaging, or debris that may have been left behind. Store the tools properly for future use.

Note: If the furniture is already assembled and you just need to move it, skip steps 3 and 5.
