Action Planning for Cleaning Pearls:

1. Gather the necessary materials: a soft cloth, mild soap, and a small bowl of lukewarm water.
2. Fill the small bowl with lukewarm water.
3. Add a few drops of mild soap to the water and mix gently.
4. Dip the soft cloth into the soapy water, making sure it is damp but not dripping wet.
5. Gently wipe each pearl with the damp cloth, removing any dirt or grime. Be careful not to apply too much pressure, as pearls are delicate.
6. Rinse the cloth with clean water and wring out any excess moisture.
7. Wipe the pearls again with the damp cloth to remove any soap residue. Allow the pearls to air dry completely before storing them.

Note: It's important to avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials when cleaning pearls, as they can damage the delicate surface.
