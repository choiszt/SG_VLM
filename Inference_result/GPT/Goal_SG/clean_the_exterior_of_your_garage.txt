Action Planning for Cleaning the Exterior of Your Garage:

1. Gather cleaning supplies: Get a bucket, a scrub brush, a hose, and a cleaning solution suitable for the garage exterior.
2. Remove any obstacles: Clear away any items or debris from around the garage, ensuring you have a clear working area.
3. Pre-rinse the garage: Use the hose to spray down the exterior of the garage, removing loose dirt and debris.
4. Apply cleaning solution: Dilute the cleaning solution in the bucket as per the manufacturer's instructions. Dip the scrub brush into the solution and scrub the garage exterior, focusing on any areas with visible dirt or stains.
5. Rinse off the cleaning solution: Use the hose to thoroughly rinse off the cleaning solution from the garage, ensuring there is no residue left behind.
6. Dry the garage: Allow the garage to air dry or use a clean towel to speed up the drying process.
7. Return cleaning supplies: Clean and dry the scrub brush, empty and rinse the bucket, and store all the cleaning supplies in their designated place.

Note: Before starting the task, ensure you have the necessary safety equipment, such as gloves and eye protection, if required.
