Action Planning for Cooking Chickpeas:

1. Soak the chickpeas in water overnight to soften them.
2. Drain and rinse the chickpeas thoroughly.
3. Place the chickpeas in a large pot or pressure cooker.
4. Add enough water to cover the chickpeas completely.
5. Bring the water to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer.
6. Cook the chickpeas for about 1-2 hours (depending on the desired tenderness) or follow the instructions of your pressure cooker.
7. Once cooked, drain the chickpeas and they are ready to be used in various dishes or stored for later use.

Note: If you prefer to use canned chickpeas instead of dried ones, you can skip steps 1 and 2. Simply open the can, rinse the chickpeas, and they are ready to be used.
