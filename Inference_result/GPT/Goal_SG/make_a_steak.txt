Action Plan for Making a Steak:

1. Gather the necessary ingredients: steak, salt, pepper, and any additional seasonings or marinades you prefer.
2. Preheat a grill or stovetop skillet to high heat.
3. Season the steak generously with salt, pepper, and any other desired seasonings.
4. Place the steak on the preheated grill or skillet and sear it for approximately 3-4 minutes on each side for medium-rare doneness. Adjust cooking time based on your preferred level of doneness.
5. Remove the steak from the heat and let it rest for a few minutes to allow the juices to redistribute.
6. Slice the steak against the grain into thin strips or desired portions.
7. Serve the steak hot with your choice of side dishes or accompaniments. Enjoy your delicious steak!

Note: Remember to follow proper safety precautions while handling hot surfaces and cooking equipment.
