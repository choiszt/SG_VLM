Action Plan for Cleaning Mushrooms:

1. Gather necessary supplies: a colander, a clean kitchen towel, and a bowl of water.
2. Take the mushrooms out of their packaging and place them in the colander.
3. Rinse the mushrooms under running water to remove any dirt or debris. Gently rub each mushroom with your fingers to ensure thorough cleaning.
4. Fill the bowl with water and submerge the mushrooms for a few minutes to further remove any dirt or impurities.
5. Lift the mushrooms out of the water and transfer them to the colander to drain.
6. Pat the mushrooms dry with a clean kitchen towel to remove excess moisture.
7. Your mushrooms are now clean and ready to be used in your desired recipe.
