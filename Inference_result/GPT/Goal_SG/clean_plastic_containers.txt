Sure! Here's a simple 7-step plan for cleaning plastic containers:

1. Gather all the plastic containers that need to be cleaned.
2. Fill a sink or basin with warm soapy water.
3. Place the plastic containers in the soapy water and let them soak for a few minutes.
4. Use a sponge or brush to scrub the containers, paying extra attention to any stubborn stains or residue.
5. Rinse the containers thoroughly with clean water to remove any soap residue.
6. Leave the containers to air dry or dry them with a clean towel.
7. Once dry, stack the clean plastic containers neatly for storage or immediate use.

I hope this plan helps you with your task!
