Action Planning for Making Baked Pears:

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Wash and slice the pears in half, removing the core and seeds.
3. Place the pear halves on a baking sheet or in a baking dish, cut side up.
4. Drizzle the pear halves with honey or maple syrup for added sweetness.
5. Sprinkle cinnamon and a pinch of salt over the pear halves for flavor.
6. Bake the pears in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes or until they are soft and slightly golden.
7. Remove the baked pears from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes before serving.

Note: You can also add a sprinkle of chopped nuts or a dollop of yogurt on top of the baked pears for added texture and taste. Enjoy your homemade baked pears!
