Action Planning for Defrosting Freezer:
1. Unplug the freezer from the power source to ensure safety.
2. Remove all the items from the freezer and place them in an alternative storage area, such as a cooler or another freezer.
3. Open the freezer door and allow it to defrost naturally. You can place towels or absorbent materials around the freezer to catch any water that may drip.
4. While the freezer is defrosting, clean the interior with a mixture of warm water and mild detergent. Be sure to remove any ice or frost buildup.
5. Once the freezer is completely defrosted, use a clean cloth or sponge to dry the interior thoroughly.
6. Plug the freezer back into the power source and set it to the desired temperature.
7. Return the items back to the freezer, ensuring they are properly organized and labeled if necessary.
