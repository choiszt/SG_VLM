Action Planning to Clean Dentures with Vinegar:

1. Gather necessary materials: vinegar, a small bowl, a toothbrush, and denture cleaning tablets (optional).
2. Fill the small bowl with enough vinegar to cover the dentures.
3. Remove the dentures from your mouth and place them into the bowl of vinegar.
4. Let the dentures soak in the vinegar for about 15-30 minutes to help remove stains and bacteria.
5. After soaking, take the dentures out of the vinegar and rinse them thoroughly with water to remove any remaining vinegar.
6. Use a toothbrush to gently scrub the dentures to remove any additional debris or stains.
7. Rinse the dentures one final time with water and place them back into your mouth.

Note: If your dentures require a deeper clean or have stubborn stains, you can use denture cleaning tablets in addition to the vinegar soak. Simply follow the instructions on the denture cleaning tablet package after step 4.
