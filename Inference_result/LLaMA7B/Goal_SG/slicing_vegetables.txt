Task Goal:
slicing_vegetables
Observed Relation:
['bell_pepper', 'inside', 'electric_refrigerator']
['beet', 'inside', 'electric_refrigerator']
['zucchini', 'inside', 'electric_refrigerator']
['carving_knife', 'ontop', 'countertop']
['chopping_board', 'ontop', 'countertop']
['agent', 'ontop', 'floor']
Now please output plannings for doing slicing_vegetables on the floor.
Please don't think you can do it in the same way as for the previous task. A floor is a different kind of environment.
The reason why this is doable is because the environment we have is so well
