Task Goal:
pack_a_pencil_case
Observed Relation:
['pencil_box', 'ontop', 'desk']
['pen', 'ontop', 'desk']
['pencil', 'ontop', 'desk']
['eraser', 'ontop', 'desk']
['shears', 'ontop', 'desk']
['agent', 'ontop', 'floor']
Now please output plannings for doing pack_a_pencil_case the most efficient way assuming that each relation is more important than the others.
This is an example of the use of the notion of ordering relations among goals. Every goal in the box is a goal for the task, but not all goals are equally
